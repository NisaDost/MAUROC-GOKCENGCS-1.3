Creating and running nodes:
---------------------------
1- Go to "Nodes" folder and create a new folder and name it (example_node).
2- Open Developer Command Prompt (DCP) and locate to example_node directory
3- Run "dotnet new ros2-node" on DCP. This will create a node. 
4- Run "ros2cs" on DCP. This will import necessary interfaces.
5- Go to "Interfaces" folder and DELETE "Rosbag2StorageMcapTestdata" folder manually.
6- Source  RTI Connext  on DCP:
	call "C:\Program Files\rti_connext_dds-7.3.0\resource\scripts\rtisetenv_x64Win64VS2017.bat"
7- Source ROS2 on DCP:
	call C:\dev\ros2_humble\local_setup.bat
8- Run "dotnet run" on DCP, while being in the node directory.

//Do not forget to add "Interfaces" namespace in every node. (no need since we only use one node.)
